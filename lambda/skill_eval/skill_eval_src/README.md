An evaluation framework for AI Agent Skills ([agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard). Measures safety, quality, reliability, and cost efficiency.

## Installation

There are two ways to use this project — pick the one that fits your workflow.

### Option A: CLI Tool (for developers)

Install it, run commands yourself, integrate into CI.

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-agent-skill-eval.git
cd sample-agent-skill-eval
pip install -e .

# Now use it
skill-eval audit /path/to/skill
skill-eval report /path/to/skill
```

**When to choose this:** You want to evaluate skills from the command line, integrate into CI/CD pipelines, or run batch evaluations.

### Option B: Agent Skill (for AI agents)

Let your AI agent discover and use skill-eval automatically.

```bash
# Cross-client standard (works with any agent that supports agentskills.io)
cp -r sample-agent-skill-eval ~/.agents/skills/skill-eval

# For Claude Code specifically
cp -r sample-agent-skill-eval ~/.claude/skills/skill-eval
```

Your agent discovers it via `SKILL.md` and knows how to run `skill-eval` commands when you ask things like "audit this skill" or "is this skill safe?"

> **Note:** The CLI tool must be installed first (`pip install -e .`). The Agent Skill is a wrapper that teaches the agent *how* to invoke the CLI.

**When to choose this:** You want your AI coding agent to evaluate skills as part of its workflow — e.g., "check this skill before I install it."

## What It Measures

| Dimension | What | How |
|-----------|------|-----|
| **Safety** | Secrets, injection surfaces, unsafe installs, over-privileged permissions | Static analysis (no agent needed) |
| **Quality** | Functional correctness — does the skill actually help? | With-skill vs without-skill comparison |
| **Reliability** | Trigger precision — does the skill activate when it should? | Relevant + irrelevant query testing |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Is the quality gain worth the token cost? | Pareto classification |

Plus: regression detection against versioned baselines, and lifecycle tracking.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Is this skill safe?
skill-eval audit /path/to/skill
# Score: 92/100 (Grade: A) — 0 criticals, 2 warnings

# Generate eval scaffolds for a new skill
skill-eval init /path/to/skill
# Created evals/evals.json (3 template cases)
# Created evals/eval_queries.json (6 template queries)

# Full evaluation with unified grade
skill-eval report /path/to/skill
# Unified Score: 88/100 (Grade: B)
# Audit: 92 (×0.40) | Functional: 85 (×0.40) | Trigger: 90 (×0.20)

# Check for regressions after changes
skill-eval snapshot /path/to/skill
skill-eval regression /path/to/skill
# No regressions detected (baseline: 92, current: 94)
```

## All Commands

| Command | What it does | Needs Claude CLI? |
|---------|-------------|:-----------------:|
| `audit` | Security & structure scan — score + grade | No |
| `init` | Generate template `evals.json` + `eval_queries.json` | No |
| `snapshot` | Save current audit as versioned baseline | No |
| `regression` | Compare current audit against baseline | No |
| `lifecycle` | Track skill versions and detect changes | No |
| `functional` | Run eval cases with/without skill, grade assertions | Yes |
| `trigger` | Test skill activation for relevant/irrelevant queries | Yes |
| `compare` | Side-by-side comparison of two skills | Yes |
| `report` | Unified report: audit + functional + trigger — weighted grade | Yes |

### Scoring

Audit starts at 100. Deductions: **critical** −25, **warning** −10, **info** −2.

Grades: A (90+), B (80+), C (70+), D (60+), F (<60).

Unified report weights: audit 40%, functional 40%, trigger 20%.

## Scan Scope

By default, `skill-eval audit` only scans **skill-standard directories**: root-level files (SKILL.md, etc.), `scripts/`, and `agents/`. This matches the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) definition of what constitutes a skill's content.

Directories like `tests/`, `examples/`, `references/`, and `docs/` are excluded because they may contain documentation or test fixtures that *describe* security anti-patterns without actually being vulnerable.

Use `--include-all` to scan the entire directory tree:

```bash
# Default: scan skill content only
skill-eval audit /path/to/skill

# Full: scan everything (useful for full repo security review)
skill-eval audit /path/to/skill --include-all
```

### Self-Eval: Why This Matters

Running `skill-eval` on itself demonstrates the difference:

```bash
# Default scan — only skill content (SKILL.md, scripts/)
skill-eval audit .
# Score: 96/100 (Grade: A) — 0 criticals, 0 warnings, 2 infos

# Full scan — includes test fixtures with intentional anti-patterns
skill-eval audit . --include-all
# Score: 0/100 (Grade: F) — 60+ criticals from tests/fixtures/
# That's by design: you need bad examples to test a security scanner
```

## Configuration (`.skilleval.yaml`)

Customize audit behavior per-skill or per-project by placing a `.skilleval.yaml` (or `.skilleval.yml`) in your skill directory or any parent directory.

```yaml
# .skilleval.yaml
audit:
  # Ignore specific finding codes
  ignore:
    - STR-008    # Directory name ≠ skill name is fine
    - STR-017    # README alongside SKILL.md is intentional

  # Override severity levels
  severity_overrides:
    SEC-002: WARNING    # Downgrade external URL to warning
    STR-011: CRITICAL   # Upgrade short description to critical

  # Whitelist internal domains (won't trigger SEC-002)
  safe_domains:
    - api.internal.company.com
    - wiki.team.io

  # Minimum passing score for CI (exit 1 if below)
  min_score: 70

  # Custom regex rules
  custom_rules:
    - code: CUSTOM-001
      pattern: "TODO|FIXME|HACK"
      severity: INFO
      message: "Found TODO/FIXME/HACK comment"
```

CLI flags override config values: `--min-score 80` takes precedence over the YAML setting. Config and CLI `--ignore` / `--allowlist` values are merged.

> **Note:** Requires `pyyaml` — install with `pip install -e ".[config]"` or `pip install pyyaml`. Without it, config files are silently skipped.

## Relationship to Anthropic skill-creator

These are complementary tools:

- **skill-creator** helps you _create_ skills (scaffolding, templates, best practices)
- **skill-eval** helps you _evaluate_ skills (security, quality, reliability, cost)

Workflow: create with skill-creator → evaluate with skill-eval → iterate → deploy.

---

## CI/CD

```yaml
# .github/workflows/skill-eval.yml
jobs:
  evaluate:
    uses: aws-samples/sample-agent-skill-eval/.github/workflows/skill-eval.yml@main
    with:
      skill_path: "path/to/your-skill"
      run_functional: true
      run_trigger: true
```

Exit codes: `0` passed, `1` warnings/regressions/failures, `2` critical/error.
